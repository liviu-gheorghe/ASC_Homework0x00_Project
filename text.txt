You think it's funny to take screenshots of people's NFTs, huh? You must be a very immature person to steal someone's property that they PAID for. Yeah, I said it. You're the kind of person who thinks that property theft (a seriously illegal offence) is a joke. I don't even know why you took that screenshot, because you didn't pay 1000 dollars for it. I did. The blockchain doesn't lie. Even if you try to save it, it's my property. You're just angry that you couldn't afford this priceless masterpiece. Even if you could, your fingers couldn't even click fast enough to get one of the 10000 NFTs sold. You're just mad you don't own what I own. So, delete that screenshot, or I swear, you'll be hearing from my lawyers.
